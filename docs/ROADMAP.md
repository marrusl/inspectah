## Shipped Work

### Fleet Spec 1: Aggregate (SHIPPED — 2026-05-20)

**Status:** 29 implementation commits, 3 review rounds (Tang, Collins, Thorn, Mango). Spec at `docs/specs/proposed/2026-05-19-fleet-aggregate-spec.md` (8 review rounds). Plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-20-fleet-aggregate.md` (4 revisions).

Implements `inspectah fleet aggregate` and `inspectah fleet init` commands. Aggregates N single-host tarballs into a fleet tarball with prevalence metadata. Key components:

1. **VariantSelection enum** replaces tie/tie_winner bools — schema-breaking change with load-time migration pre-patch
2. **FleetMergeable trait** with 16 implementations, generic `merge_items` function with prevalence and variant handling
3. **11 section adapters** — RPM, Config, Services, Containers, Network, Storage, Scheduled, SELinux, KernelBoot, NonRpm, UsersGroups
4. **merge_snapshots() orchestrator** — validation, canonical host ordering, section merge, target image/baseline selection, completeness merge, FleetSnapshotMeta
5. **Fleet CLI** — tarball loading, input resolution (manifest/directory/explicit), render+package pipeline, --json-only output matrix, --strict warning promotion
6. **Fleet init** — directory scan, TOML manifest generation with relative paths, baseline conflict detection
7. **Variant file staging** under fleet/variants/ with content hash naming, Containerfile draft header
8. **Fleet-aware audit report** with host counts, section coverage, variant conflicts by unique path
9. **62 files changed, +9,347 / -759 lines**, 315+ tests

### Service Intent Inference (SHIPPED — 2026-05-19)

**Status:** 13 implementation commits. Spec at `docs/specs/proposed/2026-05-19-service-intent-inference-design.md` (9 revisions, 7 review rounds). Plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-19-service-intent-inference.md` (2 revisions).

Replaced stringly-typed service filtering with typed intent inference. Only services where the operator made a deliberate choice (enable, disable, mask, or drop-in override) appear in the Containerfile. Stock-default services matching systemd presets are suppressed. Non-actionable systemd states (`alias`, `indirect`, `enabled-runtime`, etc.) dropped at collection time. Tiered omission/advisory model with structured renderer authority.

### User/Group Materialization (SHIPPED — 2026-05-19)

**Status:** Implemented. Spec at `docs/specs/proposed/2026-05-18-user-group-materialization-design.md`. Plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-18-user-group-materialization.md`.

Collects user and group data from the source host. Custom users surfaced in refine UI with per-account strategy control (skip or useradd). Password handling: omit, preserve, or new. Renders kickstart fragments, blueprint TOML, and Containerfile lines. Custom groups, supplementary memberships, sudoers rules, and SSH key references captured.

### Baseline Visibility (SHIPPED — 2026-05-18)

**Status:** Implemented. Spec at `docs/specs/proposed/2026-05-18-baseline-visibility-design.md`. Plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-18-baseline-visibility.md`.

Shared `baseline_fmt` presentation helpers render baseline comparison sections across audit, readme, and Containerfile outputs. CLI shows pull progress with live viewport during base image extraction.

### Post-Leaf Bug Fix Run (COMPLETE — 2026-05-18)

**Status:** Implemented in 16 commits. Spec at `docs/specs/implemented/2026-05-17-post-leaf-fixes.md`. Plan at `docs/plans/2026-05-18-post-leaf-fixes.md` (8 revision rounds).

**Context-only drift model:** Baseline-present packages are suppressed from the decision surface and `RUN dnf install`, regardless of Added or Modified state. Version drift is informational context only.

1. **Leaf classification quality:** `baseline_suppressed` field threads through `classify_leaf_auto` → `LeafClassification` → `RpmSection` → `recompute_view()`. Epoch normalization (`""` → `"0"`) prevents spurious drift.

2. **Service classification noise:** Three-way contract via `preset_matched_units` collector carrier. Stock-default services suppressed (~110 → divergences + unknowns only). Drop-in overrides preserved.

3. **Leaf dep-tree modal:** Per-package dependency modal on leaf cards. Flat sorted list, fleet-gated, full a11y (distinct ARIA labels, focus trap, keyboard, scroll).

4. **Version Changes context section:** New sidebar section at key `4`. Paired epoch-aware `format_evr_pair` rendering. Typed `VersionChangeEntry` in ViewResponse. Three-state empty reason. Audit table renders when populated.

## Upcoming Work

### Package Group Detection (MEDIUM — future)

Neither Go nor Rust handles `dnf group install` / anaconda group selections. Individual packages from groups (e.g., GNOME desktop) show up as separate items instead of being grouped. Potential approach: query `dnf group list --installed` and `dnf history` to detect group-installed packages, then emit `dnf group install` lines in the Containerfile.

### Fleet Spec 2: Refine

Fleet sessions in the refine crate. Resolves the provenance gate (`redaction_state: None` for fleet tarballs), adds fleet-aware refine UX: prevalence columns, threshold controls, variant comparison and selection, baseline confirmation workflow, section-level host indicators. Builds on Spec 1's merge engine, FleetSnapshotMeta, and per-section host counts. Brainstorm inputs at `docs/specs/proposed/2026-05-07-fleet-refine-product-brainstorm.md` and `2026-05-07-fleet-refine-ux-brainstorm.md`.

**Design decision for Spec 2:** Variant filenames currently use 8-char SHA-256 prefix (human-browsable). If refine needs to machine-correlate variant files back to merge-time identity, extend to full hash or 16+ chars. Decide during brainstorm whether variant files need to be machine-addressable.

### Fleet Spec 3: Architect

Takes refined fleet tarballs, discovers cross-role hierarchy, exports decomposed tarball set. May be multi-phase. Spec to be written after Spec 2 ships.

### Pre-1.0 Compat Sweep (LOW — before 1.0)

Audit and remove defensive backward-compatibility code added during the Rust rewrite. Before 1.0, old tarballs are not sacred — users re-scan. Remove: legacy snapshot field sniffing, dual-carrier fallbacks, serde(default) shims for fields that only existed in transitional schemas, and any "if old format, try X" branching. The goal is a clean codebase where every code path serves the current schema, not historical ones.

### CLI Cutover

Rust binary becomes primary `inspectah` command. Go binary deprecated.

### Post-Cutover

- Architect v2 (multi-artifact decomposition)
- TUI mode
- `inspectah build` command
